Beautyform
==========

[Demo](http://labs.augusteight.at/beautyform/)


### What's this?
a soon to be little bootstrap for beautiful forms for a good UX. 

### Why's this on github?
Because I want to share it and there doesn't seem to be the right solution for a form like this until right now. 
I put this repo up on github to force myself to keep working on this.
